          Programming professionally for 8 years. I like to create videos that explore the fine line between technical and creative with visual storytelling.

          My name is Lewis! You might know me online as <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/@CodingWithLewis">Coding with Lewis</a>, where I have built an audience of over 1,000,000 followers. I like to make videos about programming, technology and the software that controls our lives. I love learning complicated topics and explaining them in a story-driven way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of videos on my channel, I consult with startups and large enterprise companies to help them create organic content that will help them resonate with their audience naturally. I've created videos for brands channels that have reached millions of views per video.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also love talking with other programmers, entrepreneurs and creators. My perspectives are always changing in this fast-paced industry and I made this website to share my thoughts in the rawest form possible. :)

          I am a proud husband to a beautiful wife. I am based out of Canada üçÅ and was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. My other hobbies is reading (casually), video games, listening to music and film.

          I went to Lambton College in my hometown to learn programming. I then started a business with my 2 best friends where we built custom software solution for clients as well as marketing services through video and web. I recently left that business to persue my passion for creating content online <a href="https://www.tmrrwinc.com/" target="_blank">but my business partners still are taking it to another level.</a>
